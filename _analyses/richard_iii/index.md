# The significance of words

The word cloud shows the words which are overused (in black) and underused (in grey) compared to other Shakespeare plays.  Analysing individual words used in Shakespeare’s work can be just as effective as analysing an entire scene. The following examples have been analysed using WordHoard and have produced the following results:

## Sanctuary

  * It appears 8 times in total throughout the play
  * The relative use of the word compared to other historical plays is + which means it is used more frequently in Richard III than any other historical play
  * The log likelihood is 9.4** which is significant as it shows a numerical representation of the frequency with which this words occurs in this play compared to other historical Shakespeare plays
  * The ** is a graphic representation of the relevance of the word as well as how often it is used

As we can see, the word SANCTUARY occurs more frequently in Richard III than it does in any other play within the historical genre of Shakespeare’s work. We can interpret this as it is now, or we can compare it to the rest of Shakespeare’s work (not restricted to historical plays):

  * Log likelihood: 28****
  * The result is even more noticeable when compared to every other play written by Shakespeare
  * Analysis parts per 10,000 words: 2.83
  * Reference parts per 10,000 words: 0.15
  * The ‘analysis parts’ statistic is the text of Richard III itself and how many times the word SANCTUARY is used in every 10,000 words of the play
  * The ‘reference parts’ statistic is similar except it represents every other play written by Shakespeare and how often the word occurs every 10,000 words

When compared to the rest of Shakespeare’s plays, the word SANCTUARY is used more frequently in Richard III than anywhere else. These results raise several points of interest about the play as a whole, especially when we think about the context in which the word is used and the overarching themes of the play.

#### Something to think about:

  * What is the literal meaning of the word SANCTUARY? Is there a difference between what it means now vs. what it meant historically?
  * Why is it important to think about the frequency with which the word is used within the play? What does it mean in relation to the main themes at work in Richard III?
  * What is significant about the number of times it is used in Richard III compared to how often it appears in any of Shakespeare’s other plays? Does it allow us to make a comment on the themes/characters/tone/etc of Richard III in relation to the themes/characters/tone/etc of other plays?

### ‘Conscience’, ‘Grace’, ‘Holy’ and ‘Lord’:

The above words are similar to each other as they are used when talking about religious matters and concerns of the soul; something Shakespeare deals with in many of his other works. The England in which Shakespeare lived was deeply divided along religious lines as Protestantism was transformed from the outcast religion of rebels and heretics to the official religion of England in place of Catholicism. However, when Richard III was King of England, Catholicism was still in place as the official religion of the country. Therefore, Shakespeare’s play of Richard’s life could be viewed as an attempt to portray his religion as evil alongside his character.
Another thing those four words have in common is they all feature in Act 3, Scene 7:

  * CONSCIENCE: appears twice in Act 3, Scene 7 (13 in total throughout the play)

  * HOLY appears 6 times in Act 3, Scene 7 (22 in total)

  * LORD appears 17 times in Act 3, Scene 7 (216 in total)
