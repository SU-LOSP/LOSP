# Summary
Titus Andronicus is one of Shakespeare’s earliest plays, a Roman tragedy that takes place after a war with an Assyrian army, the Goths. Rome’s soldiers were led to victory by their general Titus Andronicus, but not without casualties. Having lost twenty-one of twenty-five sons to the violent conflict, Titus decides one of his hostages of war should also feel the pain of losing a child.  After sacrificing the eldest son of Tamora, the Goth’s Queen, he starts a violent cycle of retribution that underscores several key themes in the story.  With Rome’s emperor also passing away during the period of war, the process of filling an imperial power vacuum becomes important to the plot.  The deceased emperor’s two eldest sons are left vying for power, and romantic interests relating to naming an empress.  This results in political ambition and corruption driving the acts of violence as the play develops.  Through a variety of text-analysis software tools, we believe that Rome’s descent into carnal violence and deceit gives us an interesting platform to represent the themes of Titus Andronicus graphically.
