Hypothesis: each of Shakespeare’s characters will have their own unique
vocabulary and patterns of speech that will make them identifiable as the
speaker of any given piece of dialogue. 

# The Project

Over the six weeks, I have analysed and compared the dialogue of a selection of
Shakespearean characters using digital tools. 

Firstly, I selected 18 Shakespearean characters and isolated their dialogue from
their respective plays and converted it into plain text format. 

The majority of the research centred around using computer-based textual
analysis programs to analyse the characters’ speech. For the most part I used
[AntConc](http://www.laurenceanthony.net/software/antconc/) to compare these
dialogue samples and identify words that set characters apart from one another,
either through the usage of unique words, or through the frequency of more
common words. 

The results of this research were used to put together a database of various
words (around 280 words so far) and the number of times each character uses
these words.

In order to test my hypothesis, I developed several activities where the
participants would be asked to use one of the textual analysis tools to analyse
an anonymous piece of dialogue and attempt to determine the speaker from a
selection of potential “suspects”.

# Research Limitations

I initially spent a great deal of time extracting the dialogue of each character
from their respective plays, and removing the stage directions to ensure that
only their speech was included in the research. I then converted the dialogue
into plain text files to make them compatible with AntConc, my primary research
tool. However, I became aware of inconsistencies and errors within these texts,
for example, some texts may use -‘d on certain past participles, while other
    texts would use –ed (for example murder’d and murdered). 

Therefore, to ensure the most accurate research possible, I started again, this
time using character dialogue that had been carefully edited and standardised by
the Folger Shakespeare Library. While this did not include the dialogue of
several characters I had wished to research, it ensured the most accuracy
possible when it came to inputting information into my database. 

Given the time constraints and the large number of words I hoped to include in
the database, I initially restricted myself to the analysis of 10 – 12
characters, however, as my research continued, this number increased to 18.
Therefore, my findings so far only represent these 18 characters, and are not
representative of all of Shakespeare’s plays. 

Perhaps the most time-consuming part of this project was the conversion of the
raw figures into my database. AntConc only provides the number of incidences of
a word, for example, it would tell me that Hamlet uses the word ‘death’ ten
times, while Lady Macbeth uses the same word only three times. What it does not
take into account is that Hamlet has over six times the amount of dialogue as
Lady Macbeth (Hamlet: 11784 characters; Lady Macbeth: 1925 characters).
Therefore, while we could say that Hamlet uses the word “death” far more often
than Lady Macbeth, if we were to consider the incidence of this word per ten
thousand characters as opposed to the raw figures, the results would be quite
different. Per ten thousand characters, Hamlet would use the word ‘death’ 8.5
times. Lady Macbeth on the other hand would use it 15.6 times. Therefore, I
created two databases: one with the raw figures, showing the actual number of
times each character said a particular word; and the other showing the
incidences of the words per ten thousand characters, standardising my results to
allow a more accurate and fair comparisons.

# Findings

My hypothesis was that each of Shakespeare’s characters would speak in a way
that would make them identifiable from an anonymous piece of text. This can be
seen from a simple analysis of a piece of dialogue. 

<figure markdown="block">
> How now, who calls? 
> **Madam**, I am here. What is your will?
> And **stint** thou, too, **I pray thee, nurse**, say I.
> It is an honor that I dream not of.
> I'll look to like, if looking liking move.
> But no more deep will I **endart** mine eye
> Than your consent gives **strength** to make it fly.
> Good **pilgrim**, you do wrong your hand too much,
> Which **mannerly devotion** shows in this;
> For **saints** have hands that **pilgrims'** hands do touch,
> And palm to palm is holy **palmers'** kiss.
> Ay, **pilgrim**, lips that they must use in prayer.
> **Saints** do not move, though grant for **prayers'** sake.
</figure>

There are several aspects of this text that make it clear it was spoken by
Juliet. The words in bold are words that are used most by Juliet (per ten
thousand characters), while the words ‘stint’, ‘endart’, and ‘pilgrims’’ are
completely unique to Juliet. 

The use of the phrase ‘I pray thee’ also sets Juliet apart from the other
characters. ‘I pray thee’ is a less common variation of ‘I prithee’ (‘I pray
thee’ is used a total of 7 times by all 18 characters; ‘I prithee’ is used 20
times). Furthermore, of the eighteen characters in question, Juliet uses this
less common phrase the most. Therefore, it can be seen that both individual
words and phrases can make it possible to differentiate between Shakespeare’s
characters. 

One obvious flaw in this type of analysis is that people with a strong knowledge
of Shakespeare may be able to identify the speaker of a piece of dialogue
without assistance. For example, the word ‘nurse’ is a fairly clear indicator
that this dialogue may belong to Juliet. This is why I created a selection of my
own pieces of text in the style of “confession notes”. I gave volunteers a
selection of potential suspects and asked them to determine the author of the
note. This proved very successful and everyone was able to determine the author
of the fictional note by picking up on particular words. While fairly simple in
design, these tasks prove that each of Shakespeare’s characters has their own
unique vocabulary that sets them apart from the other speakers, even within
their own play.

These activities can also be used as an educational tool and an entertaining
introduction to Shakespeare’s characters and language.

# Further Research

At the moment, I have the dialogue of 60 Shakespearean characters available for
research. In time, I would like to add more of these characters to the database
in order to form a more comprehensive view of the similarities and differences
between Shakespeare’s characters. The database itself will prove to be a very
useful tool going forward, and I hope to continue expanding it in future.

While I primarily used AntConc in my research over the past six weeks, other
programmes like [Ubiqu+Ity](https://vep.cs.wisc.edu/ubiq/) could provide a much
more nuanced and comprehensive analysis of what makes each piece of dialogue
uniquely identifiable. Ubiqui+Ity allows you to search pieces of text for the
type of language or LATs (Language Action Types) that a character uses. For
example, I could search each character’s dialogue for language that indicates
negativity, confidence, or immediacy and use this to tell them apart from other
characters.

Furthermore, the results of my research have provided a number of interesting
points for further inquiry. Having previously researched the role of women in
several plays (Julius Caesar, Macbeth, and Timon of Athens), the language used
by Cleopatra in the play Antony and Cleopatra proved particularly interesting.
She has the highest incidences of words like ‘betray’, ‘betrayed’, ‘chastised’,
and ‘decieved’, and while this could be expected given that Antony married
another woman, it would be worth investigating whether or not Cleopatra’s
vocabulary sets her apart from Shakespeare’s other women. 

I would also expand my database to include function words and investigate the
differences in their usage. I would be particularly interested in determiners
and gendered pronouns.
