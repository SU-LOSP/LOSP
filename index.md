Welcome to *Language of Shakespeare’s Plays*. Our aim is to provide new and
interesting analyses of Shakespeare’s works to find things that are not always
visible to the naked eye.

Our findings can be used in a number of ways, as evidence in scholarly essays,
or starting points for your own investigation and analysis of the works of
Shakespeare, and literature as a whole.

We have used a variety of tools in order to examine themes, word usage and
discrepancies in Shakespeare’s works. You can download the majority of these
tools for personal use from our [Tools](/tools/) page.

This website is run by a group of students from the University of Strathclyde as
part of an ongoing collaborative project between the Computer & Information
Science and English Literature Departments. It is currently a work in progress
and we will be continually adding and expanding our research.
